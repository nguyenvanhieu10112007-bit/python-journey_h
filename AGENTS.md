# AGENTS.md — Python Journey V2

## Course contract

```text
PROJECT = Python Journey V2
DEFAULT_WORK_BRANCH = upgrade/python-journey-v2
PYTHON_BASELINE = >=3.12
LEARNING_LOOP = Learn → Build → Test → Debug → Improve → Commit → Prove
```

This repository is a beginner curriculum, not an application package.
Keep every change understandable to a learner encountering the topic for the
first time.

## Canonical ownership

- `SYLLABUS.md` is the curriculum source of truth.
- `FINAL_PROJECT.md` is the capstone source of truth.
- `README.md` is the overview and navigation entry point.
- `PROGRESS.md` is the learner tracker.
- `SETUP.md` owns installation and troubleshooting guidance.
- `STYLE_GUIDE.md` owns course-level Python style guidance.
- Week directories own their lesson content, exercises, and mini-projects.

When documents disagree, resolve the conflict in the owning document first.
Do not copy a second canonical version into another file.

## Curriculum boundary

Python Journey covers reliable Python foundations across 15 weeks.
The locked curriculum is:

1. Environment, REPL, terminal, Git/GitHub, and Hello Python.
2. Variables, types, and input/output.
3. Conditionals, Boolean logic, and input validation.
4. Strings, text processing, and a regex mini-lab.
5. Lists, tuples, mutability, and unpacking.
6. Loops, `enumerate`, `zip`, and comprehensions.
7. Functions, decomposition, scope, and basic type hints.
8. Dictionaries, sets, nested data, and data modeling.
9. Midterm Project.
10. Files, `pathlib`, CSV, and JSON.
11. Exceptions, tracebacks, debugging, and defensive coding.
12. Testing with pytest.
13. Modules, packages, dependencies, CLI, and API/HTTP.
14. OOP essentials, composition, and basic inheritance.
15. Capstone, tests, README, and Git/GitHub evidence.

Do not move advanced engineering material into this course merely because a
tool supports it. Advanced typing, concurrency, design patterns, packaging for
publication, and testing architecture belong in later courses unless the
syllabus explicitly says otherwise.

Do not rename or migrate week directories as part of unrelated tooling work.
Legacy week content may temporarily lag behind the canonical syllabus while
the V2 migration proceeds in separate drops.

## Learning design priorities

Apply these priorities in order:

1. Evidence over assumption.
2. Simple design over unnecessary complexity.
3. Learner clarity over feature count.

Prefer small examples with visible behavior. Introduce terminology only when
it helps learners reason about code. Each exercise should have a clear purpose,
an observable result, and an appropriate way to verify the result.

Do not rewrite learner starter files solely to make broad lint or test commands
green. Starter code may intentionally be incomplete. Maintainer checks must be
kept separate from learner exercises.

## Maintainer verification

The blocking maintainer checks are:

```bash
python scripts/verify_course.py
pytest
ruff check scripts tests projects/vuacoc-bot-journey
git diff --check
```

`pytest` is configured to collect repository invariant tests in `tests/` and
stable infrastructure tests in `projects/vuacoc-bot-journey/tests/`. Learner
tests inside week directories are run explicitly from their owning lesson; do
not add unfinished learner exercises to default collection.

Use these commands to measure existing course content without turning legacy
debt into a release blocker:

```bash
python -m compileall -q weeks
ruff check weeks
```

Report failures from the measurement commands honestly. Fix them only when the
active task explicitly includes the affected week content.

Maintainer dependencies are declared in the `dev` dependency group in
`pyproject.toml`. Install them with:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade "pip>=25.1"
python -m pip install --group dev
```

## Python and tooling policy

- Support Python 3.12 and newer.
- Treat `.python-version` as a convenience hint, not an override of the
  canonical baseline.
- Use Ruff only on the scope authorized by the current task.
- Use pytest for automated maintainer checks and learner tests introduced by
  their owning curriculum drop.
- Keep the course health verifier standard-library only.
- Avoid adding package metadata when the repository is not being distributed
  as an installable package.
- Never require secrets for course health checks.

## Git governance

- Work on `upgrade/python-journey-v2` unless the owner explicitly authorizes a
  different branch.
- Confirm repository root, branch, status, HEAD, and remotes before editing.
- Preserve unrelated user changes and stop if a clean baseline is required but
  the worktree is dirty.
- Keep commits scoped to one curriculum drop or one coherent maintenance task.
- Read the complete diff before committing.
- Do not force-push.
- Do not merge `main` as a shortcut during a scoped drop.
- Do not create a new branch unless the owner requests one.
- Do not commit secrets, virtual environments, caches, or generated bytecode.

## Change discipline

Follow the explicit file scope of the active task. If a necessary change falls
outside that scope, stop and report the dependency instead of silently
expanding the change.

Keep Markdown links relative inside the repository. Preserve UTF-8 Vietnamese
text. Keep Python examples compatible with the declared baseline. Favor
standard-library examples until an external dependency is itself the lesson.

Before handoff, state which checks ran, which passed, and which were only
measurements. Never report PASS for a command that was not executed.
